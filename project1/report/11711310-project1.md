# CS323 Project 1: Flex & Bison

11711310 Junda Ai

## Required features

- Resolve the dangling-else shift/reduce conflict with %prec directive
- Print parse tree if no lexical error or syntax error were found
- Report lexical errors and syntax errors if any, and don't print parse tree
- Support hexadecimal form of integers and characters

## Bonus feature

- Single line comment: implemented using only flex

Identify single line comments by the regex:

```c
SINGLE_LINE_COMMENT "//".*
```

Return nothing to bison if the pattern was matched:

```c
{SINGLE_LINE_COMMENT} {
#ifdef DEBUG
                        printf("flex: found single line comment, line %d\n", yylineno);
#endif
                      }
```
